Every day that I'm alive, I¡¯ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain¡¯t no way I'ma switch
Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it with us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really ****ed me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats
